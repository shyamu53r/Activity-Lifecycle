# Activity Life Cycle

**Activity** :- It is the *single screen* in android. It is like *window* or *frame of Java*.

The **Activity lifecycle** is the set of states an activity can be in during its entire lifetime, from the time it's created to when it's destroyed and the system reclaims its resources. It is important to know about Activity Lifecycle as it helps developers understand which states activities go through when a user navigates through an app. See Below image for better understanding.

**Different Stages of Activity Lifecycle :-**

1. **onCreate	called** when activity is first created.
1. **onStart	called** when activity is becoming visible to the user.
1. **onResume	called** when activity will start interacting with the user. 
1. **onPause	called** when activity is not visible to the user.
1. **onStop	called** when activity is no longer visible to the user.
1. **onRestart	called** after your activity is stopped, prior to start.
1. **onDestroy	called** before the activity is destroyed.
